Instructions for running the .pddl files using the fast downward solver.

1. Download the planner from http://www.fast-downward.org/
2. There are instructions on how to install it. You need a few dependencies obtainable by a packet manager.
3. Clone the repo mentioned in the instructions
4. Create the default build (32-bit). Just follow the instructions on the page.
5. After compiling it, it can be used to solve .pddl problems.
6. For solving, it needs three things:
  a) a domain.pddl file specifying the problem domain.
  b) a problem.pddl specification about the problem instance.
  c) instructions on which algorithm to use.

EXAMPLE:
Assumtions: Planner was unpacked in downward/, and the test files exist in dwpddl/
The following promt causes fast-downward to solve the problem using the a-star algorithm with a landmark-cut heuristic:
./downward/fast-downward.py dwpddl/example1/path.pddl --search "astar(lmcut())"

More information on additional algorithms and parameters are available on the website from (1).
