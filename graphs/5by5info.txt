The grid-based graph will assume that the edges are undirected, meaning that an edge from (x,y) to (z,k) implies that there is also an edge from (z,k) to (x,y).

The coordinates are based around a grid-based approach, and takes place entirely in the first quadrant of a Cartesian coordinate system.
This means that for a 5x5 graph, the grid will be based from (0,0) to (4,4).

Therefore, the starting point for the grid based map will always be in the origin (0,0), and then work its way outwards with positive X and Y coordinates.

The edges will exclusively be vertical or horizontal. There are no diagonal edges.
The format of the files are as follows:

Two integers, representing the total size of the grid (i.e. "5 5" for a 5x5 grid).
One integer, displaying the total number of edges present in the graph (i.e. 23 for 23 edges).
A number of edge coordinates, displayed as x,y z,k, for an edge between the Cartesian coordinates (x,y) and (z,k).
