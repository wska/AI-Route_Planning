#Instructions for the genetic algorithm

The genetic algorithm only requres a set of python modules to be installed.
The following modules need to be available on the running computer:
* simanneal
* networkx
* matplotlib + pyplot


To run the genetic algorithm:
1. (OPTIONAL) Specify the problem setting to be used. The problem files can be located in graph/
2. (OPTIONAL) Adjust the hyperparameters of gasolve.py. The parameters can be found in the main function.
3. python3 ga/gasolve.py
